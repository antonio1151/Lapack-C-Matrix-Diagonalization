# Lapack-C-Matrix-Diagonalization

This is a simple C++ program for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of any square matrix using the LAPACK library.

Diagonalization is handled by the "diagonalization" class, which is defined in the file "Matrix_diag.cpp".

To learn how to use it, refer to the examples in "input.cpp".
